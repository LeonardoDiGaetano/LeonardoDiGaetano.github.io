I am a postdoctoral researcher with dual affiliations at the [Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone](https://www.int.univ-amu.fr/) and the [Centre de Physique Théorique, CNRS, Aix-Marseille Université](https://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr/). My research lies at the intersection of network science and neuroscience, with a strong focus on the theoretical foundations of network science and their application to understanding the organization and dynamics of brain networks.  

I earned my PhD in [Network and Data Science](https://networkdatascience.ceu.edu/) at [Central European University](https://www.ceu.edu/), under the supervision of [Federico Battiston](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=it&user=aDf1nroAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), with [Michele Starnini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=duBif0oAAAAJ&hl=en) as an external advisor.
